OK, how to make a regular dead simple Battleship implementation to be more like **Not your father's battleship**?

## Gameplay ideas

1. Not square field (check out [this review](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/605234/bravo-battleship) and read more about [hexagons](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons))
1. Restoring fog of war plus moving ships
1. Ships against coastal defense
1. Aircraft carrier (5 cells) - relatively easy to find and sink, but it gives exploration data with some chance to locate one cell ships

## Technical ideas

1. Run Python on Android
1. Switch to voxel engine
